				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Who is TUMY?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY is short for TaeyeonUnionMY, a fanbase created on July 2017 for Kim Taeyeon and fans. TUMY is handled by four different admins who initially didn't even know each other until TUMY is created. All four admins work hand in hand to make the fanbase approachable and working. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How can I apply to become a TUMY admin?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY is currently not looking to recruit anyone, unless you are a graphic designer and a translator. If you are a graphic designer and an expert in handling Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop as well am willing to work for free, please email us with subject "RECRUIT TUMY" and your intentions as well as attaching your previous sample artworks.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">How do I contact TUMY?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There are three different ways for you to contact TUMY; email (taeyeonfanunionmy@gmail.com), Twitter (@TaeyeonUnionMY) or ask.fm (ask.fm/taeyeonUnionMY). We prefer e-mail because we like to keep our DMs cluster-free from spamming and unnecessary questions. </p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO REQUESTS</h2></li>
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you accept GO requests?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, TUMY accept requests to manage/open a GO for fansites. Do note that if you requests GO for official SUM products or official merchandises, TUMY might take a while to open them because we have to find reliable and trusted supplier. We also might refuse to open one if we cannot find a supplier.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Do you only accept GO requests for Taeyeon? What about other members?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We accept any GO requests from any current and <em>previous member</em> of SNSD, which includes Jessica Jung. </p>

			<li class="cd-faq-title"><h2>GO FAQS</h2></li>
						
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Is there a minimum order for each GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Unless it's the SNSD Album GO, there is no minimum order. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What are the terms and condition of joining TUMY's GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We have some rules that you need to adhere before you consider joining. Below are the rules.
					<br><br>
					1. Strictly no cancellation once you've made order and payment.<br>
					2. Strictly no refunds for whatever reason. This is because ALL fansites operate on a non-refund basis. TUMY will not fork out our own money to pay for your order.<br>
					3. You should ONLY order if you can be patient. It takes 1-2 months for fansite masternim to produce the goods, 1-2 weeks for the goods to reach TUMY and at most 1 week for TUMY to post the goods to you.<br>
					4. All of our fansite GOs will have a second payment where it is necessary for you to pay PayPal fees + currency exchange fees + EMS (international shipping from Korea to Malaysia) + domestic Korean postage and local EM/WM postage.<br>
					5. Strictly do not ask for second payment estimation. It depends entirely on the weight of the parcels.<br>
					6. TUMY will not send out your goods until you pay for second payment.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why do I have to pay for domestic Korean postage when there's already international shipping fee?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Your goods will be delivered to a Korean address where our helper there will pack and combine all goods to be shipped together and save a lot on international shipping. Instead of sending 5 sets (e.g $47) from fansite A and 7 sets (e.g $31) from fansite B separately, it will be combined to get 12 sets (e.g $50) from fansite A and B and shipped together. Please do note the shipping price is just used as an example and does not represent the actual shipping cost. Again, this depends on the weight of the goods and how many orders we receive.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is PayPal fee and why do I have to pay for it?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>There is always a risk when handling (us) or participating (you) in a group order. We're giving our money to an unknown person (a fansite). Fansites are usually trusted and reliable but there is no guarantee that you will not get scammed. TUMY also cannot refund you back the money since it's not in our hand in the first place. Unlike banking through Korean bank, with PayPal Goods & Service, you are protected as a buyer to get your money back guaranteed. PayPal will immediately refund back your money if you did not receive your goods. And since most of fansite goods are worth more than RM100, it's better to pay an extra approximately RM1-6 rather than losing RM100+ of your money that you'll never get back.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why is there a currency exchange fee?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Most fansites only accept USD as their main currency. PayPal will automatically convert the total MYR money we've received from each GO and and deposit it in the fansite master-nim's PayPal in USD.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Your currency exchange rate is not the same as Google! Why is that?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Currency exchange rate is set by the bank. Every bank has different rates and they do not rely on Google. </p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
						
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">What is EMS?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>EMS is the international shipping fee to ship your goods from Korean to TUMY in Malaysia. EMS fee will be divided equally by the number of orders we receive. The more people join, the lower the EMS fees. This is because EMS has a very high base fee. However, as the weight increases, the price will only increase a few USD.</p>

						<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Alright, I'm interested! How do I join the GO?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY will always attach an order Google form for you to fill it. Each GO has its own specific info (deadline, pricing, ETA, banking details). Please go through all the info carefully before you join. Below is the common procedure for the GO:
					<br><br>
					<br>1. Please make your payment into the bank account stated in the GO. Some GOs will have different banking details as it will be handled by different admins in order to avoid confusion.
					<br>2. If you're using online transfer, PLEASE include this email: taeyeonfanunionmy@gmail.com if prompted in the recipient email when making online banking transfer.
					<br>3. Fill in this form. Please immediately fill in the form after you've made payment or you might forget to fill it.
					<br>4. Wait for 24-48 hours for TUMY to confirm that we've received your payment.
					<br>5. We will send out deposit payment confirmation.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm overseas right now but I would like to join the GO. Can I make payment through PayPal?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Yes, you may. Please DM us for TUMY's PayPal details. Kindly cover the G&S fees and deposit ONLY in USD. This is because fansites only accept in USD. Do note that if you're not in overseas, it's better to make payment through local bank.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Oh, no! I missed the deadline and the order form is closed. Can I still order?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>No. TUMY is very puntual with deadline. We will always give out the time and date of deadline for each GO. We will not entertain any latecomers.</p>
				</div> <!-- cd-faq-content -->
			</li>
			
					<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I'm scared the EMS fee will be expensive. Can I know how many people have ordered?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Please check our Twitter. After every order filled, we will always update the status so that people have an inkling of how much they need to pay for EMS.</p>

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">I heard you're doing a fan project/backstage support. Can you explain more?</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>TUMY will not disclose this until we reach our target for the fundraising project. This is because TUMY needs to have money in order to kickstart the fan project and there is no point in discussing about the fan project if we do not have the necessary funds to start the fan project. TUMY's main priority right now is to sell the fankits. Once we reach our limit for the fankit, then we can talk about a possibility of a fan project/backstage support. Kindly be reminded that the admins of TUMY are all college students, so you cannot expect us to fund the fan project with our own money. We hope this question will not arise again until we make official announcements about it.</p>
